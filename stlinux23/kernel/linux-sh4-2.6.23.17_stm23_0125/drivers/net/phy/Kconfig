config STE10XP
	depends on PHYLIB
        tristate "Driver for STM STe10Xp PHY"
        ---help---
          This is the driver for the STe100p and STe101p PHYs.
	  The STe101p PHY is found on the ST DB666 daughter card for the MB411.
	  The STe100p PHY is found on the STb7109REF (CoCo) board.
          Say Y if you want it compiled into the kernel. To compile this
          driver as a module, choose M here.

config NATIONAL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for National Semiconductor PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the DP83865 PHY.

config MICREL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Micrel PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the KSZ8041 PHY.

config FIXED_PHY
	bool "Driver for MDIO Bus/PHY emulation with fixed speed/link PHYs"
	---help---
	  Adds the platform "fixed" MDIO Bus to cover the boards that use
	  PHYs that are not connected to the real MDIO bus.

	  Currently tested with mpc866ads and mpc8349e-mitx.
