config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel using
	  MEMORY_START.

	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below.

	  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel

	  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

config EISA

	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel

	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.
