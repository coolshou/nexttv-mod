SMSC9118 beta driver 0.56 for Xscale on Linux 2.4.21-rmk1-pxa1-intc2

This driver is built and tested on Intel Mainstone II board (Rev.B, PXA270 B0/C0).

Linux Kernel is from ARM Linux Site (http://www.arm.linux.org.uk) and
SMSC modified some of kernel files to be able to support SMSC9118 100/10 Ethernet chip
connected to Expansion slot of Intel Mainstone Board.
*NOTE*
Original Mainstone Board has issue in CPLD code to access Expansion slot.
To use expansion slot on Mainstone, CPLD should be reprogrammed.
Unfortunately, there is no official release for that.
SMSC got help from Intel and resolved the issue in house.

The issues to port to another platform.
- Current beta driver is built to run on Mainstone II board.
   To make it run on the other systems, some part of driver need to be changed.

- Physical Address of SMSC9118
   CS5 is used for Expansion slot on Mainstone II board, SMSC9118 is mapped to CS5 area of PXA270 processor
   CS5 is mapped to 0xF2000000~0xF20FFFFF (virtual address)

- Interrupt
   It uses irq number of 198.
   User can modifiy PLATFORM_IRQ in xscale.h for different value.

- DMA channels
   This driver uses DMA channel 1 as Rx DMA and 2 as Tx DMA.
   (See PLATFORM_RX_DMA and PLATFORM_TX_DMA in xscale.h)
   If those channels are assigned to other devices, these should be changed not to be conflict to other systems.
   *NOTE* This part will be updated.
