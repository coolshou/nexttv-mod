Below are the steps you need to follow to help out the team with
testing/debugging of the rt73 kernel module:


1. Get the latest source from the CVS tree.
    Easiest way to do this is to download the hourly tarball from our
    website: http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/rt73-cvs-daily.tar.gz
    Alternatively, you can anonymously check out the current CVS code:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@rt2400.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/rt2400 login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@rt2400.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/rt2400 \
co -P source/rt73

2. Compile the module with debug logging:
    $ make clean
    $ make debug

3. Ensure there are no copies of the module left in memory:
    # ifconfig wlan0 down
    # rmmod rt73

4. Load the module with full debug enabled:
    # insmod rt73.ko debug=31
    Then proceed as usual (config, ifup, etc)...

5. Check the debug output.
    It is located in your system log file (most likely /var/log/debug
    or /var/log/syslog). If you don't see any debug you probably need
    to add the following line to your /etc/syslog.conf and reboot:

       kern.=debug       /var/log/debug

    If you system hard-locks before it's able to log anything
    interesting in these files, you'll have to rely on the netconsole
    module to remotely log your kernel messages to another box (see
    netconsole.txt in your kernel sources Documentation folder).

6. Report the following to the rt2400-devel mailing list (or rt73
   forum):
    * Steps to reproduce the bug
    * The _whole_content_ of your debugging output
    * Your module details, i.e. the output of:
      # modinfo rt73.ko
    * Your kernel details, i.e. the output of:
      $ uname -a
    * Your rt73 hardware manufacturer, model and revision
    * Anything else you think may help us resolve the issue (even a
      patch if you are so inclined)

7. Monitor the mailing list (or forum thread) for replies/further
   queries.  :-)

Whenever we do major changes to the source - and always just before a
release - we will call for testing to be done before we make the
general release. You're very much welcome to help us with this testing
and report any success/issue you experience with this code.


!!!! NOTE !!!!

AS PER STEP 6 ABOVE: Please provide the *whole* debug output! The last
few lines are hardly any good.
If it's large (which it will be) then GZip it. Either attach it to
your forum post or, if you're going to report via the mailing list,
upload it somewhere and give a link to it (or email it directly to the
developer you are working with).

!!!! END NOTE !!!!
